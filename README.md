# Car-Data-Analysis

## Data Collection Process

Our group consisted of three members: Diya, Tommy, and Philip. We each recorded vehicle speed data separately at different times during the week of April 7th - April 14 2025, near the intersection of 30th St and 24th Avenue in Rock Island, IL.

Each member was responsible for documenting:
- The vehicleâ€™s speed (measured via a radar detector)
- The time of observation
- Weather conditions
- Date
- License plate state
- Color and type of vehicle

### Data Collection Shifts
- **Diya** recorded on April 7th between 4:30 PM - 5:15 PM.
- **Tommy** collected data on April 9th 4:15 PM - 4:50 PM.
- **Philip** collected data on April 14th 2:15 PM - 3:15 PM.

### Communication and Coordination

To organize the assignment, we set up a group chat via Snapchat, where we planned our recording times to ensure no overlap and full coverage throughout different parts of the day. We shared our individual data in a shared Google Sheet, which we then exported as a CSV for analysis in R.
